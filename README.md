# Simplified Theme for doing task 2.1

This is your first Web Development Section task, which is the 2.1 task.

**If you so desire, you can use this project as a start for the remainder of your web development tasks.**

*The final due date will be by end of the Web Development Section.*

[Here is a screenshot of what you are working toward](task-2.1.png)

In this task you will:

* git clone or download this repository to your computer
* drag the 
     index.html 
file into your browser (or you can double-click the index file and it will launch in your default browser)
* resize the browser so that you can see how the text reflows
* open up the Atom editor, Choose 
      File > Add project folder 
      and open the downloaded repository
      
* read the 
     stylesheet-links.md 
     
     file. Link the three css files in your ```index.html``` file. DO NOT do this all at once
* follow the instructions in the [stylesheet-links.md](stylesheet-links.md) file when linking one by one
* follow the instructions in the [google-fonts-links.md](google-fonts-links.md) file. *Its okay to do this all at one time.*
* put the google sanita font-family code in the ```nav.css``` file. (You can look at the ```style.css``` to see how it is done there)
* once you have completed all of these tasks duplicate the ```index.html``` file twice and name one ```about.html``` and the other ```contact.html```
* change the header 1 content on each page so that you can see that the navigation is working.
* change the paragraph text on each page also.
* finally, git push to your website repository on your UNC source control Account.

*The google fonts are not downloaded. You just link to them and they work across the internet.*
