This is your first task which is the 2.1 task.

Recommended due date:As soon as possible! Class will go a lot smoother for you
on Wednesday if you get this done before coming.

**If you so desire, you can use this project as a start for the remainder of your web development tasks.**

*The final due date will be by end of the Web Development Section.*

In this task you will

* git clone or download this repository to your computer
* drag the index.html file into your browser
* resize the browser so that you can see how the text reflows
* open up the Atom editor, Choose ```File > Add project folder``` and open the downloaded repository
* read the stylesheet-links.md file. Link the three css files in your index.html file. DO NOT do this all at once
* follow the instructions in the stylesheet-links.md file when linking one by one
* link to two different Google fonts. In your index.html file. Its okay to do this at one time.
* follow the instructions in the google-fonts-links.md file when linking
* put the google sanita font-family code in the nav.css file. (You can look at the style.css to see how it is done there)
* once you have completed all of these tasks duplicate the index.html file twice and name one about.html and the other contact.html
* change the header on each page so that you can see that the navigation is working.
* change the paragraph text on each page also.
* finally, SFTP the 2.1-task folder into your public_html file. Do not put it into your home folder or any other folder.


*The google fonts are not downloaded. You just link to them and they work across the
internet.*
